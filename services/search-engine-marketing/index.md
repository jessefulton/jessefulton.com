# Search Engine Marketing Service

We know it's not enough to just build a great app, you also need people who use it. That's where search engine marketing comes into play.

In order to get more traffic to your website, we strategically help you position your website in major search engines like Google. High search engine rankings mean more traffic, which means more users for your web application.

## The Secret Other Marketing Services Won't Tell You

While many other companies promise #1 positions, not all search engine marketing services are created equal.

The tactics many companies use to improve your search engine ranking are meant to game Google's algorithm and get you short term results. Then, when Google inevitably updates their ranking algorithm, your rankings drop. You're right back where you started, spending more money on search engine marketing that won't last.

## How We Do Web Marketing Differently
