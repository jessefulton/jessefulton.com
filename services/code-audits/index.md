# Source Code Audit

Does your current application have many bugs? Does it take your developers a long time to add new features and, even when complete, they break other portions of the site? Is the performance of your site poor?

{% pullquote %}
These are key indicators that there may be something fundamentally wrong with your current code base or the architecture of your system. {" An audit is a great way to understand the investment you have made in your web application "} and helps you to make more informed business decisions.
{% endpullquote %}

## Does Your Code Adhere to Best Practices?

Many developers have their own tried-and-true way of doing things. Although they may be consistent in how they write your application, these are not necessarily best practices. The Ruby on Rails community, and the software community at large, have established guidelines for best practices in software development. Our code audit will identify best practices in use within your web application as well as those that have been neglected.

Our detailed report will reveal the level of code debt that you've accumulated over time and will advise you on the steps required to improve the maintainability of your web application.
