description:
  The Serendipity Engine is a non-interactive installation which
  serendipitously dispenses "<a href="/portfolio/captchafy">CAPTCHA-fied</a>"
  book pages at random intervals from the ceiling above the viewer.
  In the same sense that technology companies
  are trying to feed us information before we ask for it, The Serendipity
  Engine shows us the effects of digitization on cultural artifacts without
  our asking.
  

  Documentation coming soon. More information can be found in 
  <a href="/thesis.html">my MFA thesis</a>.
