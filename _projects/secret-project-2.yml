description:
  After 3 grueling months of work with a fantastic team at Huge/KingCoyle lead by creative directors Ian Coyle & Duane King, 
  I helped lead the technology team in the design and installation
  of the digital client experience for a system used to help create custom-designed shoes in 15 minutes at a retail store in Portland.

  Cinder-based touch screen experience, iOS applications for three employee roles, and a server to manage and synchronize all orders and external communications.
  
  rhymes with "likey"

  Unfortunately, that's about all I can say about this project, but you can see what others have been saying about it to hopefully see and
  learn more about it. Or you can just ask me about it person...
