  After 3 grueling months of work with a fantastic team at 
  <a href='http://hugekingcoyle.com/'>Huge/KingCoyle</a> 
  lead by creative directors Ian Coyle & Duane King, 
  I lead the technology team in the design and installation 
  of the digital client experience for a system used to help create 
  custom-designed shoes in 15 minutes at a retail store in Portland.


  Customers designed their custom shoes on a giant touch screen
  application written in Cinder. After submitting their orders, an employee
  would be notified via a custom iOS application written for one of three
  employee roles. A Node.js server manages order lifecycle and reporting, as
  well as delegating all communications to external third-party APIs.


  I don't think I can say much more than that, but if you want more details, feel free
  to <a href="/contact">ask me</a> or maybe try 
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22SWOOSHiD%22">this google search</a> 
  to see what other people are saying about the experience.
