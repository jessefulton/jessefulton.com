  "Webpages for Humans is a web application that creates a version of the Internet which is only readable by humans. Screen-scraping technology is used to generate images of webpages which are then processed by Optical Character Recognition software to find machine-readable text on the page. This text is then \"<em><strong>CAPTCHA-fied</strong></em>\" to create a distorted and manipulated rendering of that webpage. This previously machine-readable text, is distorted using the same algorithms used in CAPTCHA tests to ensure the computer programs can no longer decipher them."
