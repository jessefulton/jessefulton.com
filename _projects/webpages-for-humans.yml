  "It is a web application which generates the \"Human Web\" - a series of navigable CAPTCHA-ﬁed webpages. When users ﬁrst visit the site, they can enter a URL into a form which brings them to the CAPTCHA-ﬁed HTML page for that URL. From this point on, any links clicked within the page will continue to be CAPTCHA-ﬁed by the web server.
  
  CAPTCHA-fy is the term I use to distort text to the point where it become unreadable by Optical Character Recognition. This technique is the only reason why CAPTCHAs work."
