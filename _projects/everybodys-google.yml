  "Everybody's Google is a piece of software which programmatically controls a set of Google user accounts and navigates them through the World Wide Web. Each account represents a particular set of stereotypes: a young man living in London who is interested in technology and gambling; a teenage girl from Atlanta interested in fashion, celebrities, and pop music; a middle-aged conservative Christian businessman from rural Virginia; and a liberal, Californian mom-to-be, interested in women's rights.
  
  As each account traverses the internet, Google uses their browsing behavior to build a profile used to personalize their web experience. This includes, but is not limited to search results. Everybody's Google allows visitors to search the web from the perspective of each of these four personas."
