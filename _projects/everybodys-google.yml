  "Everybody's Google is a piece of software which programmatically controls a set of Google user accounts and navigates them through the World Wide Web. Four new Google accounts were created, each representing a particular set of stereotypes: a young man living in London who is interested in technology and gambling; a teenage girl from Atlanta interested in fashion, celebrities, and pop music; a middle-aged conservative Christian businessman from rural Virginia; and a liberal, Californian mom-to-be, interested in women's rights."
