  Simone is a memory game for the <a href="http://www.mignonette-game.com/" title="Mignonette Game">Mignonette</a> game kit. It is based on the Milton Bradley game "Simon."

  I created the game (software only.)

  When I wrote this game, I hadn't used the C programming language in over 5 years, nor had I ever done any microcontroller programming. I refreshed my C, learned the Mignonette platform, and							then programmed the game logic, "music," and "graphics," all in about 3 hours.
