  <i>CAPTCHA-fy!</i> served as the manifesto for Ocular Character Recognition, part of
  my <a href="/thesis.html">Master's thesis</a> which condenses the thesis' core
  ideas surrounding digital culture into a 12-page hand-made pamphlet.
  The document connects the concepts of 
  <a href="/portfolio/webpages-for-humans/">Webpages for Humans</a>
  to those of <a href="/portfolio/everybodys-google/">Everybody's Google</a>. 
  <i>CAPTCHA-fy!</i> demands us to "Appropriate the digital" and "Reclaim the physical"


  Each pamphlet was handmade and hand-bound, with block printed covers. 
  The cover showed a a computer-generated, laser-cut "CAPTCHA-fy!" logo,
  contrasting highly with the hand-made, DIY aesthetic of the rest of the 
  pamphlet and the low-quality, xeroxed inner pages.
