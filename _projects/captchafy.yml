description:
  "CAPTCHA-fy! served as the manifesto for the Ocular Character Recognition project, linking the concepts of Webpages for Humans and the Serendipity Engine to the ideas within the project as a whole. Each manifesto was handmade and hand-bound. The covers to the booklets were identical - each with the computer-generated \"CAPTCHA-fy!\" text block printed onto a piece of thick, dark drawing paper. The block prints were created by etching a digital image into a linoleum block using a laser cutter. This created very crisp, pristine, and machine-like lines which contrasted well with the hand-made, DIY aesthetic. The inner pages were low-quality xerox copies, further reinforcing this conﬂicting man-made/machined aesthetic.

  The JavaScript library was used to generate the cover image and some of the internal pages of the CAPTCHA-fy! booklets. A high-resolution version of the CAPTCHA-ﬁed cover text was etched into a block of linoleum using a laser cutter. The images for the inner pages where laid out using Adobe InDesign and then copied at a low-quality setting on a standard Xerox machine."
