# TODO: rename this to "VJ" or "Live Video Art" - add felix culpa, darc, etc.

  In 2010, I began developing my practice as a VJ. This started with me building my own custom controller and sampler (link)
  which I later abandoned for more widely supported solutions. I have worked a handful of private parties, as well as more formally
  been a part of First Fridays at Felix Culpa gallery, Third Thursdays at the Museum of Art & History, the Zero1 Festival, and 
  provided visuals and videography for Karlton Hester's production of Divine Particles Vision performances.

  (reel coming soon)
