  In 2010, I began playing shows around the San Francisco Bay area with
  a small informal collective of performers. I have worked a handful of private parties, as
  well as more formally having performed at
  <a href="http://www.felixkulpa.com/2011_andthentherewaslight.html">First Fridays in Santa Cruz</a>,
  the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3rp5W7i7Ho">GLOW Festival</a>, and
  the <a href="http://www.zero1biennial.org/">Zero1 Biennial</a>. I also collaborated with Drew Detweiller in producing visuals for video and stage
  for <a href="http://www.drewdetweiler.com/31930/323475/gallery/divine-particles">Karlton Hester</a>'s production of Divine Particles Vision.
