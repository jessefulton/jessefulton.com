  This is the second in a series of pieces analyzing what people on Twitter are saying to or about United States President, Barack Obama (@BarackObama on Twitter.) As new messages are displayed, the image of President Obama shows a slight emotional reaction based upon that message's emotional valence which is calculated by analyzing Tweets with the EmoTe API.

  Pairing Shepard Fairey's iconic imagery with the wide variety of commentary coming from Twitter creates some interesting juxtapositions. The EmoTe API also has trouble dealing with certain language, especially "internet shorthand" and sarcasm. Occasionally, this causes the animated Obama to behave differently than expected, causing you to rethink what you really know about @BarackObama.
