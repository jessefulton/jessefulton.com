  While writing my MFA Thesis, I began freelancing at HUGE LA developing an HTML-based user interface for a consumer electronics device.
  While the project never saw the light of day, it required highly optimizing the UI through traditional HTML/JS/CSS, as well as optimizing
  the underlying embedded OS and ensuring all required functionality was performant on the extremely limited hardware of the device.
