  While writing my MFA Thesis, I began freelancing at 
  <a href='http://hugeinc.com/'>Huge LA</a> 
  developing an HTML-based user interface for a consumer 
  electronics device. While the project never saw the light of 
  day, it required a highly optimized the UI and core platform 
  to run on the embedded OS. It was my task to design the software 
  in close conjunction with the hardware designers 
  and ensure that all required functionality was performing at or above
  expectations on the extremely limited hardware of the device.

  
  Unfortunately, that's about all I can say about the project due 
  to NDA's. You can try to ask me more, but I probably won't say much
  for another few years...
