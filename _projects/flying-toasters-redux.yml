  In 1989, the screen saver served a dual purpose: to prevent the traditional CRT display from "burn out"; and (perhaps more importantly) to serve as a display of technical prowess. "Screen saving" has since developed into a process of disabling all visual output. The art of the screen saver has been dying.
  In an effort to rekindle this aesthetic and artistry of the traditional screen saver, we (Will, Lao, and I) have brought it to the place where it can be most widely encountered: the web. Flying Toasters Redux reinterprets the iconic Flying Toasters screensaver in a networked homage to the screensaver of yesteryear.
