  In 1989, After Dark released a series of screensavers, including the iconic Flying Toasters. At this point in time, the screen save served a dual purpose: to prevent the traditional CRT display from "burn out"; and, perhaps more importantly, was a display of technological capabilities. Since these days, the screen saver is largely a dying breed. Screens go to sleep to save energy, and much of the "wow" factor has been lost as processing power becomes cheaper, better, and more prevalent.
  In an effort to rekindle the aesthetic and artistry of the traditional screen saver, we have brought it to the place where it can be most widely encountered: the web. Flying Toasters Redux reinterprets the iconic Flying Toasters screensaver in a networked homage to the screensaver of yesteryear.
  In 1989, users would sit in front of their computer and purposefully *not* interact with it, in order to "turn on" the screen saver and engage with or simply view the spectacular visuals generated by this piece of software. Passive interactivity... non-interactive interactivity
