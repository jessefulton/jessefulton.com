  <a href="socialappslab.com/airquest/">Air Quest</a> is an iOS game being developed by the 
  UC Berkeley <a href="http://socialappslab.com/">Social Apps Lab</a> to educate players about 
  global air quality conditions in order to encourage civic action.
  
  Gameplay focuses on a young man named Keane living near Fresno, California - an area 
  having some of the worst air quality in the US - who uncovers a series of pollution 
  sources and ways to address those and change public 
  policy in order to improve the local air quality.
  
  Working with a team across multiple University of California campuses, I 
  was the lead developer for the project, building a prototype of the full game
  (six "mini-game" style levels and cutscenes) in Unity 3D.
