description:
  The Free Walls Project is a collaborative effort with Daniel Christopher and Tony Cutrono, currently in an early prototyping stage.

  A mobile "wall" is brought to various public spaces where people are invited to draw, paint, and collage. The wall is then mounted to a bicycle trailer which is ridden throughout the local community, displaying the final image. The images are also digitally scanned and will be documented and mapped on a website which allows exploration of the works both geographically and over time.

  The project explores ideas of what constitutes "public art," and who can create it.

  The team is currently in the process of securing a permanent venue in downtown Santa Cruz.
