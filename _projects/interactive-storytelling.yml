  The Mechatronics Research Group consisted of three students in the Digital Arts + New Media program at the University of California Santa Cruz. We are currently investigating possibilities of various installations concerned with the relationship between air quality and asthma and their socio-political effects.

  We are currently researching and prototyping projects using web-based systems, computer vision, and physical computing. The videos above demonstrate a few of the prototypes and proof-of-concepts I have been working on within the group.

  Code for the drawing machine can be found on github. Images of finished prints can be seen at Flickr.
