  As part of the summer research for the
  <a href="http://danm.ucsc.edu/research/mechatronics/idl2011">DANM Mechatronics Research Group</a>, I decided to build an
  interface for interacting with and communicating the stories of a group of 
  asthmatic children at Johns Hopkins Hospital.


  The video above shows the prototype interface consisting of a custom-built
  <a href="http://www.peauproductions.com/reardi.html">rear DI table</a>, four 
  unique physical "avatar" pieces, and a custom Processing
  sketch running the display/interactivity. The Processing sketch displays shows
  a map with "hot points." When an avatar piece is placed over a hot point on the 
  the system begins playing a video recording of the interview for that avatar
  with a particlar connection to the geographic place represented on the map.
