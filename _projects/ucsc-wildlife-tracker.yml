project_description:
  Last Spring (2011), in response to fee increases at the University of California, a UCSC student created a print of a modified UC seal addressing the issue, subtly replacing the motto of "Let There Be Light" with "Let There Be Fees." I appropriated the logo, and printed it onto about 25 "blue books" (examination books), and then planted the hacked books back in the UCSC Bay Tree Book store.
  
  The project is open source, allowing anybody to download and create their own custom blue books, and encouraging participation from students at other university systems.
