I am a creative/technologist based out of San Francisco.
In the past, I've wanted to be a photojournalist, an alpine skier,
a teacher, a restaurateur, an artist, a nomad - however, I've
always been a technologist. I'm currently the Director
of Technology at [JUXT](http://www.juxt.com).

I've got a lifetime of technical chops, and use them to create
[art and interactive experiences](/portfolio/). I've exhibited
and performed at the Zero1 Festival, The Creators Project
San Francisco, and Eyebeam Art+Technology Center.

I like it when stuff happens.

<!--
I've been fascinated by computers and technology for as long as I can remember.

I consider programming to be an art form.

I've studied graphic design, Japanese, journalism.


I'm currently the Director of Technology at [JUXT](http://www.juxt.com).
I occasionally help out the artists &amp; technologists at [CODAME](http://codame.com). 
And when I have free time, I like to work on [side projects](http://eklekt.com) and [personal projects](/portfolio/).



He holds a double degree in Computer Science and Psychology from the Johns Hopkins University and an MFA in Digital Arts and New Media from the University of California Santa Cruz.
