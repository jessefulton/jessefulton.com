I am a creative/technologist in the San Francisco Bay Area.
I've spent my whole life working with computers and experimenting
with technology, and I use that experience to create
[art and interactive experiences](/portfolio/). I've exhibited
and performed at the Zero1 Festival, The Creators Project
San Francisco, and Eyebeam Art+Technology Center.
My days are spent as the Director of Technology at [JUXT](http://www.juxt.com)
where I lead the development team in building awesome digital projects.

I like it when stuff happens.
