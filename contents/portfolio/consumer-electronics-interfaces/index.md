While writing my MFA Thesis, I began freelancing at [Huge LA](http://hugeinc.com/) developing an HTML-based user interface for a mass-produced consumer electronics device. While the project never saw the light of day, it required a highly optimized the UI and core platform to run on the embedded OS. It was my task to design the software in close conjunction with the hardware designers and ensure that all required functionality was performing at or above expectations on the extremely limited hardware of the device.

Unfortunately, that's about all I can say about the project due to NDA's. You can try to ask me more, but I probably won't say much for another few years...
