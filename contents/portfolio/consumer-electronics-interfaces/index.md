Creating rich user interfaces and incredible experiences on limited hardware.

While writing my MFA Thesis, I began freelancing at [Huge LA](http://hugeinc.com/) developing an HTML-based user interface for a mass-produced consumer electronics device. It required a highly optimized the UI and core platform to run on the embedded OS. It was my task to design the software in close conjunction with the hardware designers and ensure that all required functionality was performing at or above expectations on the extremely limited hardware of the device. I also helped design a lightweight API front-end used by the device to retrieve live data from multiple services.

For more information, you'll have to sign an NDA :).
