FPO BriefDescription

The connection between Ocular Character Recognition and Everybody's Google.

The Serendipity Engine is a non-interactive installation which serendipitously dispenses "[CAPTCHA-fied](/portfolio/ocular-character-recognition/)" book pages at random intervals from the ceiling above the viewer.  In the same sense that technology companies are trying to feed us information before we ask for it, The Serendipity Engine shows us the effects of digitization on cultural artifacts without our asking.  

Documentation coming soon. More information can be found in [my MFA thesis](/thesis.html).
