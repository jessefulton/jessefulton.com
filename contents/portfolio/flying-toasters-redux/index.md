Written in two days at #ArtHackSF, *Flying Toasters Redux* is a cutting-edge homage to the screensaver of yesteryear.

In 1989, the screen saver served a dual purpose: to prevent the traditional CRT display from "burn out"; and (perhaps more importantly) to serve as a display of technical prowess. "Screen saving" has since developed into a process of disabling all visual output. The art of the screen saver has been dying.
  
In an effort to rekindle this aesthetic and artistry of the traditional screen saver, we (Will, Lao, and I) have brought it to the place where it can be most widely encountered: the web. Flying Toasters Redux reinterprets the iconic Flying Toasters screensaver in a networked homage to the screensaver of yesteryear.

The project was selected to be shown as part of the [Where 2.0 after party](http://whereconf.com/where2012/public/schedule/detail/24912) and was also part of [The Creators Project](http://www.gaffta.org/2012/03/14/gaffta-at-the-creators-project-san-francisco/) in San Francisco.
