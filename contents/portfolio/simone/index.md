Simone is a memory game I created for the [Mignonette](http://www.mignonette-game.com/") game kit. It is based on the Milton Bradley game "Simon."

When I wrote this game, I hadn't used the C programming language in over 5 years, nor had I ever done any microcontroller programming. I refreshed my C, learned the Mignonette platform, and then programmed the game logic, "music," and "graphics," all in about 3 hours.
