Prototype interface for an interactive story. Consisted of a custom-built rear DI table, four unique physical "avatar" pieces, and a custom Processing sketch running the display/interactivity.

As part of the summer research for the [DANM Mechatronics Research Group]("http://danm.ucsc.edu/research/mechatronics/idl2011"), I decided to build an interface for interacting with and communicating the stories of a group of asthmatic children at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

The video above shows the prototype interface consisting of a custom-built [rear DI table]("http://www.peauproductions.com/reardi.html"), four unique physical "avatar" pieces, and a custom Processing sketch running the display/interactivity. The Processing sketch displays shows a map with "hot points." When an avatar piece is placed over a hot point on the the system begins playing a video recording of the interview for that avatar with a particlar connection to the geographic place represented on the map.
