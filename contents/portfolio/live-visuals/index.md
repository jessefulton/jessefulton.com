VJing events, festivals, and live performances.

In 2010, I began creating visuals for shows around the San Francisco Bay area with an small collective of performers.
I have worked a handful of private parties, as well as more formally having performed at
[First Fridays in Santa Cruz](http://www.felixkulpa.com/2011_andthentherewaslight.html), 
the [GLOW Festival](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3rp5W7i7Ho), and the [Zero1 Biennial](http://www.zero1biennial.org/).
I also collaborated with Drew Detweiller in producing visuals for video and stage for Karlton Hester's
production of [Divine Particles Vision](http://www.drewdetweiler.com/31930/323475/gallery/divine-particles).
