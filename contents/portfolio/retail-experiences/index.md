FPO BriefDescription

I lead the technology team in the design and installation of a retail experience for a system used to help create custom-designed shoes in 15 minutes at a sporting goods store in Portland, Oregon.

We delivered a full experience which allowed customers to digitally design, purchase, and leave the store with customized sneakers in less than 30 minutes.  Deliverables included a Cinder/c++ touchscreen application, a node.js/mongodb API integrated with many external services, an <abbr title="Front of House">FOH</abbr>/<abbr title="Back of House">BOH</abbr> iOS application used by store employees, as well as the networking and physical installation of the project.

For more details, feel free to [contact me](/contact/) or [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22SWOOSHiD%22) to see what other people are saying about the experience.
