Webpages for Humans is a web application that creates a version of the Internet which is only readable by humans. Screen-scraping technology is used to generate images of webpages which are then processed by Optical Character Recognition software to find machine-readable text on the page. This text is then _*"CAPTCHA-fied"*_ to create a distorted and manipulated rendering of that webpage. This previously machine-readable text, is distorted using the same algorithms used in CAPTCHA tests to ensure the computer programs can no longer decipher them.
