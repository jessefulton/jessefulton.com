Webpages for Humans converts webpage text into "CAPTCHA-fied" images, transforming the page source, specifically designed for machine readability, into a version whose contents can no longer be "read" or indexed by a computer.

Webpages for Humans is a web application that creates a version of the Internet which is only readable by humans. Screen-scraping technology is used to generate images of webpages which are then processed by Optical Character Recognition software to find machine-readable text on the page. This text is then _*"CAPTCHA-fied"*_ to create a distorted and manipulated rendering of that webpage. This previously machine-readable text, is distorted using the same algorithms used in CAPTCHA tests to ensure the computer programs can no longer decipher them.

The project has been shown as a part of [I've Got Something on Your Mind](http://danm.ucsc.edu/MFA_2012/Everybody%27s-Google-and-OCR), [OCCUPY CONTENT: WebBiennial 2012](http://webbiennial.org/wb12_gallery2.php), and [PRISM Breakup](http://prismbreakup.org).
