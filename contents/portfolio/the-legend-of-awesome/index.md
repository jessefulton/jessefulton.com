The [Legend of Awesome](http://jessefulton.com/the-legend-of-awesome/tlos.html) is a remix of the Akihabara web game [The Legend of Sadness](http://www.kesiev.com/akihabara/demo/game-tlol.html) in which you play from the perspective of the "villain." It was created as an experiment with the Akihabara platform, and completed in about a day.
