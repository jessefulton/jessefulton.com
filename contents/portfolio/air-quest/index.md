FPO BriefDescription

[Air Quest](http://socialappslab.com/airquest/) is an iOS game being developed by the UC Berkeley [Social Apps Lab](http://socialappslab.com/) to educate players about global air quality conditions in order to encourage civic action.

Gameplay focuses on a young man named Keane living near Fresno, California - an area having some of the worst air quality in the US - who uncovers a series of pollution sources and ways to address those and change public policy in order to improve the local air quality.

Working with a team across multiple University of California campuses, I was the lead developer for the project, building a prototype of the full game (six "mini-game" style levels and cutscenes) in Unity 3D.
