Currently under development, [Ad Takeover]("http://adtakeover.org/") is a Firefox add-on which transforms Internet advertisements into shared, public spaces for self-expression and communication. The add-on allows users to replace online advertisements with their own uploaded images, which any other Ad Takeover user will see. This tool has been developed in hopes of turning the web as a whole into a more interactive place in which users can create social commentaries and dialogues on potentially any website through the use of images.

Ad Takeover was largely inspired by Steve Lambert's [Add-Art]("http://add-art.org/") project.
