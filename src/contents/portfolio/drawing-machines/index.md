The Mechatronics Research Group consisted of three students in the Digital Arts + New Media program at the University of California Santa Cruz. We are currently investigating possibilities of various installations concerned with the relationship between air quality and asthma and their socio-political effects.

We are currently researching and prototyping projects using web-based systems, computer vision, and physical computing. The videos above demonstrate a few of the prototypes and proof-of-concepts I have been working on within the group.

Code for the drawing machine can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jessefulton/drawing-machine">github</a>. Images of finished prints can be seen at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessefulton/sets/72157629021647557/">Flickr</a>.
